**Client-Server Chat Application Using Java Sockets and Multithreading**
Developing a client-server chat application using Java sockets and multithreading is an excellent exercise in network programming and concurrent system design. This project involves creating a robust communication system where multiple clients can connect to a central server and exchange messages in real-time. The implementation leverages Java's powerful networking API and threading capabilities to handle simultaneous connections efficiently.

Core Components
The chat application consists of two main components:

Server Application: Acts as the central hub that accepts client connections, manages client sessions, and routes messages between connected clients.
Client Applications: Multiple instances that connect to the server, send messages, and receive messages from other clients through the server.
Technical Architecture
Server Implementation
The server employs several sophisticated networking concepts:

ServerSocket: The primary socket that listens for incoming client connections on a specified port.
Client Handlers: Dedicated threads created for each connected client to manage their communication independently.
Thread Pool: Utilizes Java's ExecutorService to efficiently manage multiple client connections.
Message Broadcasting: Implements a mechanism to distribute messages from one client to all other connected clients.
Client Implementation
Each client application features:

Socket Connection: Establishes a persistent connection to the server.
Dual-Thread Design:
Message Sending Thread: Handles user input and message transmission
Message Receiving Thread: Listens for incoming messages from server
User Interface: Can be either console-based or graphical (Swing/JavaFX).
Key Technical Challenges
Concurrency Management: Ensuring thread-safe operations when handling multiple clients and shared resources.
Network Reliability: Implementing robust error handling for network disruptions and client disconnections.
Message Protocol: Designing a simple yet effective protocol for different message types (text messages, system notifications, etc.).
Resource Cleanup: Proper disposal of resources when clients disconnect unexpectedly.
Advanced Features Implemented
Multithreaded Architecture: Each client connection runs in its own thread, allowing the server to handle dozens of simultaneous connections efficiently.
Graceful Disconnection: Proper handling of client disconnections with notification to other users.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works across different operating systems due to Java's platform independence.
Scalable Design: Architecture supports easy extension for additional features like private messaging or chat rooms.
